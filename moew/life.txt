today august 10th ,my friend said i was the one who he was admiring ...........he said that he wants to make my entire life with happiness ..........but little thing he don't know i lost my happiness ,i am still searching for my happiness but i know i cant get it from others but me & me who cant get back normal to get my happiness.
	Really i don't think i am a person who deserves such love from others but i cant accept it and make their life mess like main .


words from him:
" Hey nuvve rey neeku life long gurthundi poyi happiness ivvali anukuntunna what about you once vaddu Ane mundhu think cheyyu Baga eppudaina cheppu but don't break friends and don't be un easy with me reject chesina ok na "


i don't want to make it awkward but still it became really different after that ........... successfully again i lost that person who made me smile again.
